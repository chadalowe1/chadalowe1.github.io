                <hr>
                <br>
                <p>Welcome! I am a former computer science and math educator at the 6-12 level. Currently, I am
                an Academic Advisor for the CISC department at the University of Delaware and Master of 
                Educational Technology student researching computational thinking and computer science 
                education, with a focus on pedagogy and methods at the elementary level. My long term goal is to
                pursue a PhD in Education and Learning Sciences with the same research focus. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Teaching and working with students is a great passion of mine. I am also an ardent reader, learner, 
                and all-around nerd. 
                <br>
                <br>
